                                        SMART AGRICULTURE MONITORING SYSTEM 
PROBLWM STATEMENT:
Traditional farming methods are often inefficient due to unpredictable climate conditions, lack of real-time monitoring, improper irrigation management, and crop diseases. Farmers rely on manual observation, leading to resource wastage, reduced yield, and financial losses. The absence of automated systems results in inefficient water usage, delayed disease detection, and poor decision-making.
PROPOSED SOLUTION:
This paper proposes a Smart Agriculture Monitoring System that leverages IoT, cloud computing, and AI-driven analytics to enhance precision farming. The system integrates wireless sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The collected data is sent to a cloud platform, where machine learning models analyze patterns to predict optimal farming conditions. 
Predictive Analytics: By analyzing data collected from various sensors, IoT systems can predict crop health issues, optimize resource allocation, and forecast yields, contributing to sustainable farming practices.
